# javaSQLDatabaseConnector

Contains code for using a Java program as a front-end interface, which sends SQL queries to the database and receives the results sets via the connection. The SQL statements are sent as String objects and the results are received as "Vector of Properties" data structures.

NOTE: I believe it is important to note that over 50% of the code for this project was provided by SUNY Brockport and Prof. Sandeep Mitra, and is not of my own design.
